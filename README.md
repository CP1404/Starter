# CP1401 & CP1404 Starter Guides

This is a repository with sample Python code for IT@JCU, mainly for CP1401 and CP1404 subjects.

This repository also houses our [Wiki of useful guides](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki), including the famous:

* [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns)
* [Styles and Conventions](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Styles-and-Conventions)

# CP1404 Boot Camp

For students starting CP1404 without the normal prerequisite subject, CP1401...

The materials listed below should help a student to learn some basic programming principles, 
or to understand how principles they already know in one language (e.g., MATLAB) might apply in Python.  
There is definitely not enough here to substitute for the whole CP1401 subject.

## Programming Guides

Good programming, in any language, usually involves applying common 'patterns' and best-practices to solve problems.  
Good code is consistent, readable (easy to understand), follows accepted conventions, and other quality attributes - in
addition to simply working correctly.  
The following guides are intended as a useful reference to help you write good code (and pseudocode), particularly in
Python.

* [Instructions to set up Python, Git, GitHub and Kivy on your Windows or Mac PC](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Software-Setup)
* [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns)
* [Style Guide](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Style-Guide)
* [Good Pseudocode](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Pseudocode-Guide)

## CP1401 Practicals

If you have not completed CP1401, you can still see and do the practicals.  
Selected solutions for each practical are provided in the "solutions" branch of the repository.

## Coffee Video - SRP Demonstration

In this classic video, Lindsay makes you a very nice coffee,
breaking the task down into well-designed, reusable functions to demonstrate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
